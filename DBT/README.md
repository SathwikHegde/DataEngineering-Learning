# Official dbt Fundamentals Course Learning and Certification

This repository serves as a personal learning journal and resource collection for the official dbt Fundamentals course offered by dbt Labs. It documents my progress, key learnings, and preparation for the dbt Fundamentals certification exam.

## About the dbt Fundamentals Course

The dbt Fundamentals course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to dbt (data build tool) and its core concepts. It covers the essential skills needed to transform raw data into analytics-ready models within a data warehouse using dbt.

**Key topics covered in the course include:**

* **Introduction to dbt:** Understanding the purpose and benefits of using dbt for data transformation.
* **Project Setup:** Initializing a dbt project and connecting to a data warehouse.
* **Models:** Writing and organizing SQL-based transformation logic in dbt models. This includes defining how raw data should be cleaned, shaped, and aggregated.
* **Sources:** Declaring and managing the raw data sources that dbt uses. This allows for better tracking and lineage of your data.
* **Tests:** Implementing data quality checks within dbt to ensure the reliability and accuracy of your models. This involves writing SQL-based assertions about your data.
* **Documentation:** Generating and maintaining documentation for your dbt project, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand the data transformations.
* **Packages:** Leveraging pre-built dbt packages from the dbt Hub to extend the functionality of your dbt project. These packages can provide common transformations or utilities.
* **Jinja Templating:** Using Jinja within dbt to write dynamic SQL and create reusable code. This allows for more efficient and maintainable dbt projects.
* **Macros:** Defining reusable SQL snippets using Jinja to avoid repetition in your dbt code.
* **Seeds:** Loading static data (e.g., lookup tables) into your data warehouse using dbt.
* **Snapshots:** Tracking changes to slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) in your data warehouse.
* **Deployment:** Understanding how to deploy and run your dbt project in different environments.

## My Learning Journey

This section will contain notes, code snippets, and examples related to each module of the dbt Fundamentals course. The goal is to solidify my understanding of the concepts and provide a reference for future use.
